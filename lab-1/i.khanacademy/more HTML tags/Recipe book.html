<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> How to make crumbly rice in a frying pan? Prepare the ingredients. Peel the onion and rinse in cold water. Using a sharp knife, chop the onion finely, wetting the knife in cold water to protect the eyes. Read how to choose the perfect rice in a separate article. You will find the link at the end of the recipe.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour a little vegetable oil into a hot frying pan and add the chopped onion. Fry the onion until golden brown. Stir occasionally to avoid burning. It is convenient to do this with a wooden spatula. How to choose a frying pan and oil for frying can be found in the articles on these topics. There are links at the end of this recipe.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> While the onion is frying, prepare the required amount of rice. Rinse it several times in cold water. Then drain all the water using a colander.

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the onion is browned, add the washed rice to the pan. Stir and fry everything together for 3-4 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add a little salt and spices to the rice. To give the rice a beautiful yellow color, you can add a little turmeric. Mix everything well.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Pour the required amount of hot water into the pan. Stir and bring to a boil. Then cover the pan with a lid, turn on the minimum heat and leave to cook for about 10-15 minutes. We need the cereal to absorb the liquid.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>
  As soon as the water is absorbed into the rice, turn off the heat and leave the rice to stand under the lid for another 15 minutes. Then you can serve it hot. This side dish of rice is suitable for many dishes! Enjoy your meal!

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> How to fry lush potato pancakes with egg in a frying pan? Prepare the ingredients. Take a deep frying pan for cooking with a thick bottom and lid. Wash, peel and grate the potatoes on a medium grater. If desired, it is fashionable to squeeze the minced potato from the juice, wash it from excess starch, then the pancakes will turn out snow-white. But it is better not to do this, so the draniki will be more delicious, crispy and ruddy.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Put the grated potatoes in a deep bowl. Add salt and ground black pepper to taste. Beat in one chicken egg.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir the mixture so that the egg and spices are mixed with the potatoes.

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add flour to the potato mixture. Add it with a spoon in parts, mixing well each time to keep track of the consistency of the dough. Depending on the quality of the flour, you may need a little more or a little less. You can read more about flour and its properties in a separate article, link at the end of the recipe.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The dough should be quite thick, thicker than sour cream. Then draniki will turn out plump and lush. In a frying pan, pour vegetable oil and heat it. How to choose the perfect frying pan, as well as how to choose the right oil for frying, read in separate articles, links at the end of the recipe.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Place one tablespoon of potato batter on one of the pancakes, adjusting the edges and not letting the dough spread. When the potato dough is well set, forming a good crust on the bottom, cover the pan with a lid, make medium heat and fry for about 7-10 minutes. Then remove the lid and fry the pancakes for about 5 more minutes, then turn over and fry until browned on the second side. So fry each batch of potato pancakes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>
  Remove them carefully with a wooden spatula on a plate covered with a napkin, so that the remaining vegetable oil is absorbed into it. Serve potato pancakes to the table with sour cream and fresh vegetables and herbs. Enjoy your meal!
