<h2>About this placec:</h2>
<h3 id="first">Kualoa Ranch & Private Nature Reserve</h3>
<img alt="" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-in-hawaii.png" width="400">
<p>This ranch is kind of a big deal in the movie world. Popular with Hollywood productions, the area is now visited for ziplining and ATV riding.<br>
  If you plan on visiting, look out for cows- Kualoa is indeed an active cattle ranch, after all!<br>
  But for this view, head to Kualoa Regional Park, just across the street. <strong class="hawaii">Hawaii</strong></p>
<h3 id="second">Halona Beach Cove</h3>
<img alt="" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-with-palm-trees.png" width="400">
<p>This small beach cove boasts turquoise waters, a nearby cave, and is adjacent to a blowhole lookout!<br>

  And just a very short drive away, you will also find the Lanai Lookout.<br>

  It is effortless to get to by car and has a parking lot directly adjacent. From here, you can see Lanai, Molokai, and Maui on a clear day! <strong class="hawaii">Hawaii</strong></p>
<h3 id="third">Kaena Point & The Farrington Highway</h3>
<img alt="" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-and-lake.png" width="400">
<p>The Farrington Highway boasts spectacular views as it takes you to Kaena Point!<br>

  We got the photo above on the west side of the island with the Makua Forest in the background. You can see its exact location on the map on my post on the 50 most Instagrammable places in Oahu.<br>

  Home to a bird sanctuary and some outstanding hiking, Kaena Point is at the western tip of Oahu.<br>

  This spot holds cultural significance as the cliff from which spirits of the departed jump to enter the netherworld.<br>

  Advanced hikers will enjoy the trails here but be warned that water and sunscreen are an absolute must!</p>
<h3>Ho’omaluhia Botanical Garden</h3>
<img alt="" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/waterfall_niagara-falls.png" width="400">
<p>With a dramatic mountain backdrop almost everywhere you look, the Ho’omaluhia Botanical Garden is one of the most beautiful places in <strong class="hawaii">Hawaii</strong>, hands down.<br>

  Tip: While the main road that leads into the gardens is off-limits to photos, you can walk in before they open to take photos via a walking entrance in the gate!</p>
